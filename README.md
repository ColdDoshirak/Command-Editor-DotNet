# Command-Editor-DotNet
Rewrite of Command Editor on .NET 6

The project is completely rewritten in C# on .NET 6 with some compatibility features that allows to use older .json lists and configs. Also it's possible to export new configs in old format, that original Command Editor used.

Since Windows 7 support was dropped earlier than .NET 6, users have to install KB3063858. See [.NET Installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/core/install/windows#windows-7--81--server-2012).
